    <h2 class="story-title">The Forgotten Legend</h2>

    <p class="story-text">
      A person long ago with an unknown name lingered and wandered through the realms.  
      He was the first one ever to find a path through the realms, known as the hero  
      in his tribe and village. He produced great resources and was the first to invent  
      a new style of combat. He led his village to triumph against the first rebellious  
      group called <b>The Dreadborne</b>.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      The Dreadborne formed rebellions no man had ever seen nor imagined.  
      The terrors that slayed the villagers were controlled by the unknown,  
      and this unknown warrior was known as <b>Varoth</b>. His wrath, dedication,  
      and charisma surpassed those of the rebellions. Filled with light and justice  
      in his eyes, he marched forward—a fallen star reborn.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      He went through enemy lines like that of a horse bolting for its essence.  
      He decapitated the heads of those who marched in rebellion.  
      <b>A loyal knight and a warrior he was.</b>
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      None stood a chance against him, but <b>The Dreadborne</b> knew they couldn't  
      just win with sheer force and power. Instead, they started planning strategic  
      maneuvers to surround the lone warrior. His dedication and willpower were unmatched,  
      but the strategies of the rebellions and the veteran warriors’ skills  
      kept improving.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      On that terrible, daunting night, the warrior was surrounded. He slayed many  
      in his path, but unfortunate events unfolded on that accursed night.  
      A warrior he was, yet with no supernatural abilities to withstand the sheer strategies  
      and manpower of the rebellion. A loyal knight he was, and the cursed moment  
      approached. The fate could not have been changed—it was destiny indeed.
    </p>

    <p class="story-text">
      The cursed warrior from the rebellion struck him from behind,  
      soothing his life away, dying a hero's death and achieving <b>martyrdom.</b>

    <p class="story-text">
      His name faded with history but was never forgotten by those he served.  
      He was a memorable warrior who knew no bounds of human strength.  
      The rebellion did not end that night, nor did his name disappear.  
      A true, kind hero he was, whose remembrance slowly faded into history,  
      though not his sacrifice.
